USE THE FILE nodenames.txt TO INSERT THE HOSTNAMES YOU CREATED WITH THE FLASH TOOL

I SUGGEST USING THE CONVENTION master AND THEN node1, node2, node3, nodeN

For this demo I use master, node1, node2, node3

YOU NEED TO INSTALL ANSIBLE TO USE THIS ROLE ON YOUR PI

http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html
brew install homebrew/versions/ansible18

YOU WILL ALSO NEED SOME OTHER DEPENDENCIES
ON MAC YOU NEED SSH PASS IF YOU WANT TO NOT GET PROMPTED
install homebrew
http://brew.sh/
once that is installed and configured you will need sshpass to do it in one swoop
brew install http://git.io/sshpass.rb
